* (tema1(ex2))The value of a real number x is read from the keyboard. Write a program that calls up some math functions through the following repetitive menu:
  ```
  1 - ex
  ```

  2 - In x
  ```
  ```
  3 - | x |
  ```
  ```
  4 - 10x
  ```
  ```

* (tema1(ex4))Read a natural number n. Calculate the sum of the digits of which n is composed. The last digit of a number is the remainder of the division of that number to 10. What remains of the number is how much it is divided into 10.


  Assignment 2
* (tema2(ex1))Calculate and display the average average of a student whose notes are read from the keyboard and retained in a one-dimensional artwork. You must restrict the inserted marks to greater than or equal to 5.
* (tema2(ex2))It reads from the keyboard the elements of a matrix. Show the matrix and count how many of its elements are larger than their arithmetic mean.
* (tema2(ex3))10 words are read from the keyboard. Show a warning for those who are bigger (lexicographical) than the first word.
